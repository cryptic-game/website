## Welcome

This is the open-source source code to the official website of cryptic-game.

We develop an open source hacking browser game. This started as a community project of the Youtuber https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMorpheus407. You can already test a first pre-release of the game at https://play.cryptic-game.net. Feel free to explore our other repositories at https://github.com/cryptic-game.
